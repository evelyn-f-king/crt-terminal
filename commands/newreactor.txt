reactor crisis redesign: 
goal: more puzzle, less annoying sync puzzle
to get 1 signal in command center:
pick correct fuse order:

Substation A's fuse blew again, guys. I always forget the order you have to reset the breakers in to get the green signal.
A, C, D, B? No, that's not right. B, D, C, A?

RE: A, C, D, B. I really wish they'd give us better documentation. It's like they designed this thing to be a puzzle.

Substation B is offline, must have been something to do with the "experiment" the Science Officer attempted with my pet. 
I want my pet back, by the way. That's what we get for using all these different fuse types. I tried to tell them when we installed the medlab that we should just do it like we did A,
but nothing can be standard, of course. And why did we go with FreedomCorp? Those guys are ridiculous. Did anyone even read their brochure?
The terminal has a manual for each fuse type, although I think the Science Officer should be the one to fix it this time, since he vaporized my chinchilla.

If I get paged. One more time. For substation C. I'm gonna overload the reactor myself. It just keeps breaking randomly. I swear, I can only get the signal to light up for a few seconds when I rewire the fuse box on the other side of the bay!
Everyone else is asleep, I need help to deal with this.
