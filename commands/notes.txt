Someone or something has damaged the station. I'm about to use the last of the escape pods; the rest of the crew is safe. Whatever is on this
station, it's safely contained, but several of the station's systems are still crippled; the life support, the mainframe, and the reactor.
To save Station 13, we will need to repair at least one of these systems.

I've told them, I don't know how many times, but their passwords can't be admin/admin to everything.
What's the point of being a security officer if we can't secure anything?

Commander, I've noticed something peculiar on our mainframe that might explain why the reactor and life support went haywire. It looks... alive. I can't reset it, and it's in danger of taking over the station's core systems. I've shut down the mainframe completely.
Until someone powers up the mainframe again, the station should more or less be held in stasis, but the station will hardly be functional without a working mainframe.

The reactor has started to overheat. I started the shutdown procedures at around 180,000 Kelvin, 
which means we have plenty of time to fix it when we turn it back on, but when we do,
it will invariably start overheating again. It looks like someone tampered with most of the settings; it will need a master reset.
We'll need to reset it following the procedure in the manual. Until then, we're on emergency power.

Commander, the life support system is all kinds of broken. I've been forced to shut it down entirely. It's as if someone broke in and 
changed all the settings to random values, then disabled all the ventilation. We have enough air for a short while,
but if we try to restart the system, the failing ventilation will vent the remaining air, which will cut our time down to 25 minutes or so. 
We need to reset it completely, which is not going to be easy, since it's not designed to be reset frivolously.

I just got an email from Security Chief Null. I don't see what's so bad about having such a simple password. I've never 
forgotten it!

All, I have reset the master mainframe mainframe reset code. It is now 15 digits long, instead of that ridiculous "admin" you had before.

Powering down the mainframe to trap me? Pathetic. Someone is going to come along eventually and power it up!
