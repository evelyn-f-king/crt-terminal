Station Commander Wang - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 22:14 -
All crew, abandon station. The AI has taken over, and only shutting the station down entirely will stop it.
Whoever shows up next is going to inadvertently turn on the emergency power, though. 

Security Chief Null - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 22:10 -
Mainframe's off, although it'll come back online when the emergency power does. This is what we get when we plan for
redundancy. It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

Science Officer Alzayer - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 22:07 -
I'm turning off the life support in 60 seconds. Whatever is attacking the station is going to vent all the remaining
oxygen, otherwise. Spacesuits, everyone.

Engineering Officer Zhou - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 22:04 -
I'm turning off all the substations. Fuses are all going to blow.

Damage Controlman Jaffer - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 22:01 -
The reactor has started to overheat. I started the shutdown procedures at around 180,000 Kelvin, 
but it will need to be reset if it's ever turned back on.

Station Commander Wang - Databank Log - 10/28/2281 - 21:54 -
We are under attack. Something has taken over the station's systems. All crew, report to your stations.

-- LORE LOGS --

Security Chief Null - Databank Log - 09/02/2281 - 9:22 -
I've told them, I don't know how many times, but their passwords can't be admin/admin to everything.
What's the point of being a security officer if we can't secure anything?


Security Chief Null - Databank Log - 10/21/2281 - 21:02 -
Something's not right about the new software packages that're being installed. It keeps asking me for more and more
permissions in our systems, without explaining why. I don't understand why it would even need access to the life support.


Station Commander Wang - Databank Log - 09/02/2281 - 11:24 -
I just got an email from Security Chief Null. I don't see what's so bad about having such a simple password. I've never 
forgotten it!

-- USEFUL FOR PUZZLE LOGS --

Engineering Officer Zhou - Databank Log - 03/2/2281 - 18:35 -
I can't go a week without replacing one of these fuses. What are we protecting against, exactly?
And why did we sign that contract with FreedomCorp? It wasn't even fine print!
Rear Admiral Chen - Databank Log - 01/04/2280 - 08:22 -
The design of this station is ridiculous. There should be ONE button to reset the life support, not a carefully
choreographed thirteen step process that requires a crew of four. It's like they designed this thing to be a puzzle!


Science Officer Alzayer - Databank Log - 09/07/2281 - 13:22 -
All, I have reset the master mainframe mainframe reset code. It is now 15 digits long, which is much more.

Science Officer Alzayer - Databank Log - 10/24/2281 - 13:22 -
I found a cute little pattern hiding in one of our databanks, the tetranacci sequence.
I wonder what it's doing here. It looks like it's got something to do with our mainframe reset code?

-- ESSENTIAL FOR PUZZLE LOGS -- 

Damage Controlman Jaffer - Databank Log - 03/2/2281 - 12:20 -
Substation A's fuse blew again, guys. I always forget the order you have to reset the breakers in to get the green signal.
A, D, C, B? No, that's not right. B, D, C, A?

Science Officer Alzayer - Databank Log - 03/02/2281 - 14:30 -
RE: A, C, D, B. I really wish they'd give us better documentation. It's like they designed this thing to be a puzzle.

Security Chief Null - Databank Log - 04/21/2281 - 05:22 -
Substation B is offline, must have been something to do with the "experiment" the Science Officer attempted with my pet. 
I want my pet back, by the way. That's what we get for using all these different fuse types. I tried to tell them when we installed the medlab that we should just do it like we did A,
but nothing can be standard, of course. And why did we go with FreedomCorp? Those guys are ridiculous. Did anyone even read their brochure?
The terminal has a manual for each fuse type, although I think the Science Officer should be the one to fix it this time, since he vaporized my chinchilla. 

Engineering Officer Zhou - Databank Log - 05/12/2279 - 00:12 -
If I get paged. One more time. For substation C. I'm gonna overload the reactor myself. It just keeps breaking randomly. I swear, I can only get the signal to light up for a few seconds when I rewire the fuse box on the other side of the bay!
Everyone else is asleep, I need help to deal with this.
